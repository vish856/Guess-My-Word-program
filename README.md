# Guess-My-Word-program
Writing a program that plays a word guessing game with a user. Your program will provide a category of words to the user and a string of dashes “-----” that represent the length of the word. The user will guess the word and with each incorrect guess, your  program will reveal a letter at random, “-a---”.Upon guessing the word correctly, your program will then inform the user how many guesses they took.
